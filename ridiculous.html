<h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/19/18/06/feet-1840619__340.jpg">
<h2>Change Your Shoes!!</h2>
<p>The most ridiculous rule I ever was told was we can not bring our school shoes home. The school said we might forget to bring them the next day. I was going to a doctor's appointment right after school and I was going to leave in my school shoes, leaving my running sneakers in my locker. I started to walk and a teacher made me go all the to the 3rd floor and change my shoes.</p>
